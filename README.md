# Home-Automation-Smart-Fan
In this project, we have come with an idea of Smart Fans. Objective is to use Smart Fans
without any remote control. To achieve this, we have used gesture recognition. Using the 
least of resource (i.e., Camera Sensor), we can control the fan. Proposed system enables 
users to have interactions with Smart fans by recognizing userâ€™s gestures. Gestures will 
allow users to control speed of the fan and turn it on and off. Interacting with physical 
world using expressive body movements is much more comfortable and practical than just speaking. 
Main aim of project is to make system highly usable by all kind of people (including differently
-abled people). Otsu thresholding is applied to separate foreground and background. Finally, template
-based matching technique is developed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for recognition.
